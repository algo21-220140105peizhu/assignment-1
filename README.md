Investors use volatility derivatives to diversify and hedge their risk in equity and
credit portfolios. Since long-term investors in equity funds are exposed to downside
risk, volatility can be used as a hedge for the tail risk and replacement for the
put options. In the United States, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)
Volatility Index (VIX) measures the short-term volatility implied by S&P 500 stock
index option prices. Many people around the world use the VIX to measure the
stock market volatility over the next 30-day period. In Europe, the EURO STOXX 50
Volatility (VSTOXX) market index is based on the market prices of a basket of Euro
STOXX 50 Index Options (OESX) and measures the implied market volatility over
the next 30 days on the EURO STOXX 50 Index. For benchmark strategies utilizing
the EURO STOXX 50 Index, the nature of its negative correlation with the VSTOXX
presents a viable way of avoiding benchmark-rebalancing costs. The statistical nature
of volatility allows traders to perform mean-reverting strategies, dispersion trading,
and volatility spread trading, among others.
